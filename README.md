SE Course Planner
=============

A webapp for planning which courses one wishes to take and which year they wish to take them in.
The server here: http://khanny17.github.io/CoursePlanner loads the RIT Software Engineering curriculum by default,
but you can save your plans in the form of a JSON file and upload it later if you want to come back to it.


For testing, make sure you have npm installed and run "npm start" from a shell and go to localhost:8000
